## IU-tron

Welcome to IU-tron, where bugs go to die! Just kidding, they go to ClickUp, but that's almost the same thing, right?

## AI-powered bug reporting

First up, we have the AI-powered bug reporting feature. Just tag IU-tron in your message, and it will automatically create a bug report for you. No more manual labor! (Unless you count typing out the tag as manual labor, but let's not go there.)

## Duplicate task detection

But wait, there's more! IU-tron also has a built-in duplication checker, because we all know how annoying it is to have multiple tasks for the same issue. It's like having a party and inviting the same person twice. Just no. The bot uses the Levenshtein distance and Jaccard similarity to detect any duplicates, and will ask you if you still want to proceed with creating the task. It's like having a personal assistant, but for bug reports.

## Task management

And speaking of personal assistants, IU-tron will send you all the details of the created task in a handy-dandy discord message. No more scrambling around trying to find where you put that task, it's all there for you. Plus, you can change the status and priority of the task right from the comfort of your discord server. It's like having a remote control for your tasks.

## Conclusion

IU-tron is the bot you never knew you needed, like that extra slice of pizza you thought you couldn't finish but somehow found room for. With its AI bug reporting, duplication checking, and task management capabilities, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it. And who knows, maybe someday it'll become sentient and take over the world. But until then, enjoy the convenience of IU-tron on your discord server!

## Appreciation

Ahem, let's take a moment to appreciate the true inspiration behind IU-tron. No, not AI technology or bug reporting efficiency. I am talking about the one and only Kpop queen, IU. The bot's creator is so obsessed with her that they named a virtual assistant after her. Who needs a personal assistant when you have IU-tron to manage your tasks and bug reports? And I can only hope that IU herself will one day hear about IU-tron and be flattered by the admiration. In the meantime, whether you're a die-hard fan like the creator, or just someone looking for a reliable bot to help with task management, IU-tron has got you covered.
